# codebase

This is a collection of codes that I learnt, modified, and wrote during the self-learning journey.

These codes are mostly modified based on my own style and preferences.

I strongly recommend to go to the actual courses if you are interested in AI and DS. These are some of the best courses created in the world that have brought significant changes to my life.
